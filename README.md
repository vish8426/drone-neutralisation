Drone Detection &amp; Neutralisation - Mechatronic System

## About
The following report incorporates the design process, description and construction of the Drone Detection And Neutralisation System (DDANS). The goal of the project is to serve as protection at a venue or public event, keeping the airspace and overall sanctioned area of the event clear of all possible small scale aerial vehicles and therefore, airborne terror attacks. The system relies on hardware technologies to sense and neutralise the threat. The overall project is a mechatronic based system.
