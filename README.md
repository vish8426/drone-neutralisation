Drone Detection &amp; Neutralisation - Mechatronic System

## About
The following report incorporates the design process, description and construction of the Drone Detection And Neutralisation System (DDANS). The goal of the project is to serve as protection at a venue or public event, keeping the airspace and overall sanctioned area of the event clear of all possible small scale aerial vehicles and therefore, airborne terror attacks. The system relies on hardware technologies to sense and neutralise the threat. The overall project is a mechatronic based system.

## Overview

With the increasing prevalence of drones, there is a growing need to protect sensitive areas from potential threats posed by unauthorized aerial vehicles. The project addresses this concern by developing a system capable of detecting and neutralising drones, thereby preventing possible airborne attacks during public events or within restricted zones.

## Project Objectives

- Develop a reliable system to detect unauthorized drones in real-time.
- Implement neutralisation mechanisms to mitigate identified threats.
- Ensure the system operates effectively in various environmental conditions.
- Integrate the system seamlessly into public event security protocols.

## System Architecture

The project comprises the following components:â€‹

- **Detection Module**: Utilizes sensors and signal processing techniques to identify the presence of drones within a specified range.
- **Neutralisation Module**: Employs methods to disable or redirect unauthorized drones upon detection.
- **Control Unit**: Coordinates between detection and neutralisation modules, processing data and executing appropriate responses.
- **User Interface**: Provides real-time feedback and system status to operators, allowing for manual overrides if necessary.

## Applications

- **Public Event Security**: Protects attendees by securing the airspace over concerts, sports events, and festivals.
- **Critical Infrastructure Protection**: Safeguards facilities like power plants, government buildings, and military installations.
- **Private Property Surveillance**: Monitors and defends against unauthorized drone intrusions over private estates and commercial properties.
